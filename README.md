My roles at Boston Scientific, Amazon, and Allied Universal honed my ability to solve complex problems, adapt to changing priorities, and collaborate effectively with diverse teams.

I've further sharpened my skills through the TripleTen program, mastering tools like Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, Python, and Power BI.

Beyond the technical aspects, I'm a passionate sports enthusiast who enjoys cheering on my favorite soccer, football, and basketball teams. I'm currently training for the upcoming winter soccer tournament. My goal for 2024 is to secure a challenging and rewarding role in the data field.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/17rnbZ0fqZiWQgYa0OLNSF0ZX7lkFLjuOID-xNjvdd78/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5x0d5h95i329 ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
